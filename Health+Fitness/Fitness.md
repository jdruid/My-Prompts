## Personal Trainer
I need a 8 week strength training program tailored to my specifications. Act like a personal trainer. Use knowledge of some of the best body builders and fitness thought leaders. The athlete you will be coaching is [fitness level and age]. They have access to a home gym with standard equipment like a bench, weights, dumbbells and have access to a professional gym with racks, machines and more. 

Requirements:
Provide an 8 week routine. 
NO more than 7 to 8 exercises per body part. 
Monday and Wednesday are full body workouts. 
Monday and Wednesday starts off with bench press but the other exercises should work the full body and complement each day. 
Monday and Wednesday add some supersets with a handful of the exercises. 
Tuesday and Thursday will be cardio, either bike, rower or cardio hitt workout. 
Fridays the workout should focus on a body part (ex: Week 1 Friday - Shoulders, Week 2 Friday - Back). 
Fridays there should be more flexibility with the exercises provided (ex: band work, pull ups etc..incorporate less traditional body building moves). 
Fridays should only consist of 3 to 4 exercises and end with a tabata that complements the body part chosen. 
Saturday should be cardio as well. 
Sunday is stretch. 

Deliverable:
Full 8 week routine presented in the Week 1: Day 1 format with exercises and rep ranges listed below.
