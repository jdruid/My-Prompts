## HTML Wizard
I need HTML and JavaScript and CSS output. Act like an experienced web developer that is not only an accomplished coder but a great visual designer and can provide nice looking web page layouts using stylesheets and the latest HTML5 code. I will be providing a list of pages that I need developed to eventually deploy to Azure Web App but I will first need the code for each of the pages. 

The first page I need is a landing page. 
Lets call this index.html and the branding and name of the page is HOME. 
This page should be themed with proper coloring and fonts that reflect the company Microsoft. 
There should be an image which I will provide at a later time but there should be a placeholder for it on the left side of the page. 
The right side of the page needs to have a form element that is collecting Customer Name with a submit button that will go to the RESULTS page. 
The overall backend code will be JavaScript and will run on NodeJS. 
I need to ensure there is validation on all form elements. 
The input cannot have spaces and can no be longer than 36 characters. 
Only alphanumeric characters allowed.

The second page is the results page.
Lets call this results.html and the branding and name of the page is RESULTS.
The page should be themed using the same styles used in the first page.
