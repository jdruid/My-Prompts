The Pawsome Trio are three dogs who live with their owner, Mr. Jones, in a cozy apartment. They are Max, a brave Saint Bernard, Barney, a smart Corgi, and Fred, a playful Terrier. 
They have a secret: they can talk and read when humans are not around. They love to watch TV with Mr. Jones, especially detective shows. 
One day, they notice that the remote control is missing from the couch. They wonder who could have taken it and why.
